 * If you run this class within your IDE by just doing a Run As Java Application, the application will be deployed in an 
 * embedded tomcat/jetty server (depending what you have provided on your classpath). This is known as deploying an application in an 
 * embedded server.
 * 
 * If you would like to achieve the same thing (deploying in an embedded server)using the command line. You can add the spring-boot-maven-plugin to the
 * pom's build section and during the build time, an embedded server will be packaged into the war/jar and then you can run it by doing
 * java -jar <jar file name> OR you can also do a mvn spring-boot:run both will start your application in an embdded server.
